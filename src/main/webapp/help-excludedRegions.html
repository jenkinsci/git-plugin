  If set, and Jenkins is set to poll for changes, Jenkins will ignore any files and/or
  folders in this list when determining if a build needs to be triggered.
  <p/>
  Each exclusion uses regular expression pattern matching, and must be separated by a new line.
  <p/>
  <pre>
	myapp/src/main/web/.*\.html
	myapp/src/main/web/.*\.jpeg
	myapp/src/main/web/.*\.gif
  </pre>
  The example above illustrates that if only html/jpeg/gif files have been committed to
  the SCM a build will not occur.

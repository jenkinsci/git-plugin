<div>
  Specify the ancestors that qualify a branch as buildable.

  If no ancestors are provided, ancestry will not be used
  as a filter criteria. If multiple ancestors are provided,
  a branch will be built if it is a descendant of any of them.
  
  Any refspec may be used (e.g. SHA1, branch, or tag).

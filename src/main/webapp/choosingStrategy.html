  Specifies the strategy Jenkins will use to decide which revision to build.
  <dl>
    <dt>Default</dt>
    <dd>
      For each branch which matches the "Branches to build" (or all branches, if none are listed),
      this strategy will select those whose most recent commit has not already been built.<br>
      If multiple branches match these criteria, the oldest will be selected.
    </dd>
    <dt>Inverse</dt>
    <dd>
      This does the opposite of the "Default" strategy &mdash; any branches listed under "Branches
      to build" will <strong>not</strong> be built. For example, entering the pattern
      <tt>*/master</tt> will cause Jenkins to build any changes found on any branch, so long as the
      branch name does <em>not</em> match this pattern.<br>
      If multiple branches match these criteria, the oldest will be selected.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  For details on any other strategies that may be listed in the drop-down box above, refer to the
  respective plugin's documentation.

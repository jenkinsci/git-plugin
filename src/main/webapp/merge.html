  These options allow you to perform a merge to a particular branch before building. 
  For example, you could specify an integration branch to be built, and to merge to master. 
  In this scenario, on every change of integration, Hudson will perform a merge with the master branch, 
  and try to perform a build if the merge is successful.
  It then may push the merge back to the remote repository if the Git Push post-build action is selected.

  Specify the repository to track. This can be a URL or a local file path.
  Note that for super-projects (repositories with submodules), only a local file
  path or a complete URL is valid.  For instance, user@host:/path is not a valid
  URL.  The following are examples of valid git URLs.
  <ul>
    <li>http://github.com/github/git.git</li>
    <li>git://github.com/github/git.git</li>
    <li>ssh://git@github.com/github/git.git</li>
    <li>ssh://user@other.host.com/~/repos/R.git (to access the repos/R.git
    repository in the user's home directory)</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  If the repository is a super-project, the
  location from which to clone submodules is dependent on whether the repository
  is bare or non-bare (i.e. has a working directory).
  <ul>
    <li>If the super-project is bare, the location of the submodules will be
    taken from <i>.gitmodules</i>.</li>
    <li>If the super-project is <b>not</b> bare, it is assumed that the
    repository has each of its submodules cloned and checked out appropriately.
    Thus, the submodules will be taken directly from a path like
    <code>${SUPER_PROJECT_URL}/${SUBMODULE}</code>, rather than relying on
    information from <i>.gitmodules</i>.</li>
  </ul>

  For a local URL/path to a super-project,
  <i>git rev-parse --is-bare-repository</i>
  is used to detect whether the super-project is bare or not.
  <br>
  For a remote URL to a super-project, the ending of the URL determines whether
  a bare or non-bare repository is assumed:
  <ul>
    <li>If the remote URL ends with <i>/.git</i>, a <i>non</i>-bare repository is
    assumed.</li>
    <li>If the remote URL does <b>NOT</b> end with <i>/.git</i>, a bare
    repository is assumed.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

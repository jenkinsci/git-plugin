<div>
 If set, and Jenkins is set to poll for changes, Jenkins will pay attention to included and/or excluded files and/or
  folders when determining if a build needs to be triggered.
<p/>
 Using this behaviour will preclude the faster git ls-remote polling mechanism, forcing polling to require a workspace thus sometimes triggering unwanted builds, as if you had selected the <b>Force polling using workspace</b> extension as well.

<div>
  First builds will populate the changelog with the latest commit, if any, to allow Pipelines to check and test for file changes.
  By default, no changelog is generated for the first build because the first build has no predecessor build for comparison.
  When the first build changelog option is enabled, the most recent commit on the branch will be used as the changelog of the first build.

  The default behavior is to use the Git commit's "Committer" value in Jenkins' build changesets.
  If this option is selected, the Git commit's "Author" value would be used instead.
  <p/>
  Using this behaviour will preclude the faster git ls-remote polling mechanism, forcing polling to require a workspace thus sometimes triggering unwanted builds, as if you had selected the <b>Force polling using workspace</b> extension as well.

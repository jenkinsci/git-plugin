<div>
  If set, and Jenkins is set to poll for changes, Jenkins will ignore any revisions committed by users in this list when determining if a build needs to be triggered. This can be used to exclude commits done by the build itself from triggering another build, assuming the build server commits the change with a distinct SCM user.
  <p/>
  Using this behaviour will preclude the faster git ls-remote polling mechanism, forcing polling to require a workspace thus sometimes triggering unwanted builds, as if you had selected the <strong>Force polling using workspace</strong> extension as well.
  <p/>Each exclusion uses exact string comparison and must be separated by a new line.
      User names are only excluded if they exactly match one of the names in this list.
  <p/>
  <pre>auto_build_user</pre>
  The example above illustrates that if only revisions by "auto_build_user" have been committed to the SCM a build will not occur.

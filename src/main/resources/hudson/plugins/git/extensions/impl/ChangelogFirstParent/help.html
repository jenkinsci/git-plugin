<div>
  When determining the changelog that include merge commits, the default behavior is to walk the history of all the parents of the merge commit.
  With this option, use the --first-parent argument to limit the changelog to the commits from the first parent history.  Effectively this means to only include commits made to the currently checked out branch.

<div>
  Specify, whether commits, excluded from polling should be hidden in changes listings.<br/>
  If a commit is excluded and this option is set, you should be able to see the commit by clicking on <i>Show X exluded</i> link.<br/>
  If the options is not set, all commits should be shown in changes list with ability to hide excluded commits by clicking <i>Hide excluded</i>.<br/>
  Default behaviour (if the git extension is not added at all) is to hide excluded commits.

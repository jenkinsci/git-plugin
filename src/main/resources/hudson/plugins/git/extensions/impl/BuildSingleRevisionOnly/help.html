    Disable scheduling for multiple candidate revisions.<br>
    If we have 3 branches:<br>
    ----A--.---.--- B<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\-----C<br>
    jenkins would try to build (B) and (C).<br>
    This behaviour disables this and only builds one of them.<br>
    It is helpful to reduce the load of the Jenkins infrastructure.

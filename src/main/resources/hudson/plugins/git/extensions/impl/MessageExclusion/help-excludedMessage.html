    If set, and Jenkins is set to poll for changes, Jenkins will ignore any revisions committed with message matched to
    <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">Pattern</a> when determining
    if a build needs to be triggered. This can be used to exclude commits done by the build itself from triggering another build,
    assuming the build server commits the change with a distinct message.
    <p/>Exclusion uses <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">Pattern</a> matching
    <p/>
  <pre>
    .*\[maven-release-plugin\].*
  </pre>
    The example above illustrates that if only revisions with "[maven-release-plugin]" message have been committed to the SCM a build will not occur.

<div>
  Each inclusion uses <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">java regular expression pattern matching</a>,
    and must be separated by a new line.
  An empty list implies that everything is included.
  <p/>
  <pre>
    myapp/src/main/web/.*\.html
    myapp/src/main/web/.*\.jpeg
    myapp/src/main/web/.*\.gif
  </pre>
  The example above illustrates that a build will only occur, if html/jpeg/gif files
  have been committed to the SCM. Exclusions take precedence over inclusions, if there is
  an overlap between included and excluded regions.

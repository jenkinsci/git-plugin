  If given, checkout the revision to build as HEAD on this branch.
<p>
  If selected, and its value is an empty string or "**", then the branch
  name is computed from the remote branch without the origin.  In that
  case, a remote branch origin/master will be checked out to a local
  branch named master, and a remote branch origin/develop/new-feature
  will be checked out to a local branch named develop/newfeature.
<p>
  Please note that this has not been tested with submodules.

<div>
 Configure comma separated white- and blacklists of branches that trigger builds or avoid triggering builds.
 You need to define the branch names without refs/, remotes/, origin prefixes. The branch names need to match exactly.
 <p/>
 If one of the lists is empty, it is not considered at all. If you define both, the whitelist is considered first.
 If the branch is not whitelisted, the blacklist will not be considered.
 <p>
  Using this behaviour will preclude the faster git ls-remote polling mechanism, forcing polling to require a workspace thus sometimes triggering unwanted builds, as if you had selected the <b>Force polling using workspace</b> extension as well.

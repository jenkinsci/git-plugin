  <dd>
    Expands to the Git SHA1 commit ID that points to the commit that was built.

    <dl>
      <dt>length=N (optional, default to 40)</dt>
      <dd>
        Specify the commit ID length. Full SHA1 commit ID is 40 characters long, but it is common
        to truncate it at 8 or 12 as that usually provide enough uniqueness and is more legible.

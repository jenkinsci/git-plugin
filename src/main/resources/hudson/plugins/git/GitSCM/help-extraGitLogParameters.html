  <p>
	  If given, when the git log command is run to generate the change log, these parameters are used.<br/>
	  Note: This can break the parser, so don't add flags that change the format, but rather change what commits are shown.<br/>
	  An example where this is useful: set this value to "--first-parent -m" without the quotes to tell Jenkins not to list all the commits of the merge, but just show the actual merge commit.<br/>
	  By default the following flags are passed in and cannot (and should not) be overwritten: "--no-abbrev", "-M", "--pretty=raw".

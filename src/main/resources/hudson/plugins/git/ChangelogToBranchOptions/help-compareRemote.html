<div>
    Name of the repository, such as <tt>origin</tt>, that contains the branch you specify below.  Current build parameters and/or environment variables can be used in form: ${PARAM} or $PARAM.  Can be blank to use a local reference (e.g. branch, tag or other revision syntax which supports being prefixed by "^"). <strong>Note:</strong> Due to uncertainty of determining if local reference is valid for automated tests: if the remote is blank, this setting will be ignored unless you use 'Check out to specific local branch' as well.

  Specify tags to push at the completion of the build.<br/>
  If the "Create Tag" option is selected, the tag will be created and pushed at the completion
  of the build, and the push will fail if a tag with the given name already exists. If the "Create Tag"
  option is not selected, the push will fail if the tag does not already exist.<br/>
  Environment variables may be used in the tag name - they will be replaced at build time.<br/>
  The repository name needs to be one of the repositories configured in the SCM section above.

<div>
    Minimum age of tags (in days) to <strong>include</strong> when discovering tags.
    Tags newer than this value are ignored.
    Tag age is calculated from the tag creation / commit timestamp to the time the
    scan runs.
    Leave this field blank to <strong>not</strong> filter out tags based on a minimum age
    (no lower age bound).
    Examples:
    <ul>
        <li><code>7</code> – ignore tags created in the last 7 days (only tags at least 7 days old are used).</li>
        <li><code>0</code> – do not ignore tags for being too new (equivalent to leaving it blank).</li>
    </ul>
    When used together with <em>Ignore tags older than</em> (<code>atMostDays</code>),
    this value should be less than or equal to the <em>older than</em> value to define a valid age range.
</div>

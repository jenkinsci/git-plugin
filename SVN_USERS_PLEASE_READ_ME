Hello.

Since you're looking at the git plugin, you're presumably a git user.

If you're wanting to make changes, please clone the git repository at

https://github.com/hudson/Hudson-GIT-plugin

Changes here are periodically squashed back into SVN - if you don't use this route, then changes
are potentially lost in SVN if they don't merge cleanly with master.

== Version 3.4.0 (July 17, 2017)

* Refactor the Git Branch Source UI / UX to simplify configuration
and enable configuration options to be shared with dependent plugins
such as GitHub Branch Source and Bitbucket Branch Source
(https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-43507[JENKINS-43507]).
Please consult the linked ticket for full details. The high-level
changes are: +
** There were a number of behaviours that are valid when used from a
standalone job but are not valid in the context of a branch source and a
multibranch project. These behaviours did not (and could not) work when
configured against a branch source. These behaviours have been removed
as configuration options for a Git Branch Source.
** In the context of a multibranch project, the checkout to local branch
behaviour will now just check out to the branch name that matches the
name of the branch. The ability to specify a fixed custom branch name
does not make sense in the context of a multibranch project.
** Because each branch job in a multibranch project will only ever build
the one specific branch, the default behaviour for a Git Branch Source
is now to use a minimal refspec corresponding to just the required
branch. Tags will not be checked out by default. If you have a
multibranch project that requires the full set of ref-specs (for
example, you might have a pipeline that will use some analysis tool on
the diff with some other branch) you can restore the previous behaviour
by adding the "Advanced Clone Behaviours". Note: In some cases you may
also need to add the "Specify ref specs" behaviour.

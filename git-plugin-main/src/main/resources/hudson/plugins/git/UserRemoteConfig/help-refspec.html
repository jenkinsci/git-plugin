    A refspec controls the remote refs to be retrieved and how they map to local refs. If left blank, it will default to
    the normal behaviour of <code>git fetch</code>, which retrieves all the branch heads as <code>remotes/REPOSITORYNAME/BRANCHNAME</code>.
    This default behaviour is OK for most cases.

    <p>
    In other words, the default refspec is "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/REPOSITORYNAME/*" where <code>REPOSITORYNAME</code> is the value
    you specify in the above "name of repository" textbox.

    <p>
    When do you want to modify this value? A good example is when you want to just retrieve one branch. For example,
    <code>+refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master</code> would only retrieve the master branch and nothing else.

    <p>
    The plugin uses a default refspec for its initial fetch, unless the "Advanced Clone Option" is set to honor refspec.
    This keeps compatibility with previous behavior, and allows the job definition to decide if the refspec should be
    honored on initial clone.

    <p>
    Multiple refspecs can be entered by separating them with a space character.
    <code>+refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master&nbsp;+refs/heads/develop:refs/remotes/origin/develop</code>
    retrieves the master branch and the develop branch and nothing else.

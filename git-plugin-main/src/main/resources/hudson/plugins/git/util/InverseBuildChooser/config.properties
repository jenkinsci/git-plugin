blurb=Build all branches <strong>except</strong> for those which match the branch specifiers configure above. \
  This is useful, for example, when you have jobs building your <code>master</code> and various \
  <code>release</code> branches and you want a second job which builds all new feature branches &mdash; \
  i.e. branches which do not match these patterns &mdash; without redundantly building \
  <code>master</code> and the release branches again each time they change.

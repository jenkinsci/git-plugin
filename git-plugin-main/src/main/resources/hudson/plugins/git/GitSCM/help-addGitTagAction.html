  If checked, the git tag action will be added to any builds that happen <strong>after</strong> the box is checked.
  Prior to git plugin 4.5.0, the git tag action was always added.
  Git plugin 4.5.0 and later will not add the git tag action to new builds unless the administrator enables it.

<p>
  The git tag action allows a user to apply a tag to the git repository in the workspace based on the git commit used in the build applying the tag.
  The git plugin does <strong>not</strong> push the applied tag to any other location.
  If the workspace is removed, the tag that was applied is lost.
  Tagging a workspace made sense when using centralized repositories that automatically applied the tag to the centralized repository.
  Applying a git tag in an agent workspace doesn't have many practical uses.

<p>
    Select the Git client implementation used by git-plugin.
    git-client plugin provides both a JGit pure java implementation, and a wrapper for command line git.
    Depending on selected advanced behaviors, a specific git-client may be required, but if both are compatible
    this option will select the one to be used.

    Please give JGit a try and report on jenkins-user@googlegroups.com any issue you encounter with it.

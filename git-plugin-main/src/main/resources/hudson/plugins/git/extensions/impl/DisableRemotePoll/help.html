       Git plugin uses git ls-remote polling mechanism by default when configured with a single branch (no wildcards!).
       This compare the latest built commit SHA with the remote branch without cloning a local copy of the repo.<br><br>
       If you don't want to / can't use this.<br><br>
       If this option is selected, polling will require a workspace and might trigger unwanted builds (see <a href="https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-10131" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JENKINS-10131</a>).

  Clean up the workspace before every checkout by deleting all untracked files and directories,
  including those which are specified in <code>.gitignore</code>.
  It also resets all <em>tracked</em> files to their versioned state.
  This ensures that the workspace is
  in the same state as if you cloned and checked out in a brand-new empty directory, and ensures
  that your build is not affected by the files generated by the previous build.

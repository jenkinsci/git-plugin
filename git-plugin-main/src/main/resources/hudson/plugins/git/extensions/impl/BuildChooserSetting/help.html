    When you are interested in using a job to build multiple heads (most typically multiple branches),
    you can choose how Jenkins choose what branches to build in what order.

    <p>
    This extension point in Jenkins is used by many other plugins to control the job to build
    specific commits. When you activate those plugins, you may see them installing a custom strategy
    here.

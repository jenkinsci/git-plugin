  This checkbox cause the all revisions to be be ignored apart from the last one if a build is already in the queue.<br/>
  Does not combine entries with builds of manually started downstream job that are queued. (Ones that do no have a git hash attached to them)<br/>
  Warning: There is no consideration for multiple branches, or any other behaviour,
it is your responsibility to make sure that the hashes provided come from the same branch.
